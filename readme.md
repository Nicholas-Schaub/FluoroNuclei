# Hand Labeled, Fluorescent Nuclei Database
This repository links to data used to train a convolutional neural network for segmentation of cellular nuclei. Images are collected from publicly available databases and are preprocessed into a common format.

Currently this repository is in a state of flux, and as details of the formats are made more concrete this readme will be update. In addition to this, a team of experts are hand labeling data where necessary so that all data is high quality.

This repository makes use of Data Version Control that is currently stored on an S3 bucket. You will not be able to use this unless a special permission key is generated for you. If you are interested in using this database you may contact the curator (nick.schaub@axleinfo.com). We are only opening the database up to a limited number of individuals, but welcome suggestions of data sets to include in this repository. The data will be slowly released as it is curated and visually inspected.
